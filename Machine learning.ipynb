    "Definition: Artificial Intelligence involves the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It encompasses learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.\n",
    "Example: Developing algorithms that can recognize patterns in data to make predictions, such as predicting customer behavior based on past purchases.\n",

    "Definition: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data.\n",
    "Example: Training a model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on the content and characteristics of previously labeled emails.\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning where artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain's structure and function, learn from large amounts of data. It enables machines to learn hierarchical representations of data through layers of neural networks.\n",
    "Example: Using deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images based on their content, such as identifying objects or faces in photographs."
